>*Note, this gif is from an older version of the generator, updated case stls have cutouts for usb and TRRS ports.*

These files are intended to be 3d printable cases for the rollow split ergo keyboard with various tenting angles and boarders.

Made with Grasshopper it Rhino 3D, this script can control:

- Bezel thickness
- Keyboard height
- Top and/or bottom edge 
	- square, filleted, or chamfered
	- fillet/chamfer radius
- Internal cutout
	- USB and TRRS cutouts
- Switch plate(separate file)
- Tenting angles up to 35 degrees

**A complete case consists of 4 files: A left and right switch plate as well as a left and right bottom case. Any switch plate should be compatible with any case.**

**The internal standoff holes are designed for use with 4mm m2 heat set threaded inserts.** You will need 10 and can find them on McMaster-Carr here, one pack is enough: (Brass: https://www.mcmaster.com/94459A120/ Aluminum: https://www.mcmaster.com/94459A418/ Stainless steel: https://www.mcmaster.com/94459A432/ )


Note/Disclaimer: I've never actually designed anything to be 3d printed before, so I can't guarantee it'll print perfectly or have correct tolerances. If you try it and notice issues, please contact me and I can fix it. The best way is on discord via the low profile keyboards server. https://discord.gg/69UM9sQF8q

If you would like a configuration that is not already in this repository, contact me in the #gb-rollow channel on the low profile keyboards server and I can try to make it for you. I may make 3x6 version too if demand is there.
