These files are intended to be 3d printable cases for the rollow split ergo keyboard with various tenting angles and boarders.

Made with Grasshopper in Rhino 3D, this script can control:

- Bezel thickness
- Keyboard height
- Top and/or bottom edge 
	- square, filleted, or chamfered
	- fillet/chamfer radius
- Internal cutout
- Switch plate(separate file)
- Tenting angles up to 35 degrees

A complete case consists of 4 files: A left and right switch plate as well as a left and right bottom case. Any switch plate should be compatable with any case.

Note/Disclaimer: I've never actually designed anything to be 3d printed before, so I can't guarantee it'll print perfectly or have correct tolerances. If you try it and notice issues, please contact me and I can fix it. The best way is on discord via the low profile keyboards server. https://discord.gg/69UM9sQF8q

If you would like a configuration that is not already in this repository, contact me in the #gb-rollow channel on the low profile keyboards server and I can try to make it for you. I may make 3x6 version too if demand is there.
